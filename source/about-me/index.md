## Profile ##

Being friendly and outgoing when working as part of a team, I am able to demonstrate excellent leadership and communication skills, even in the most stressful situations my relaxed and confident personality shines through. Being in the company of others is very important to me and the ability to talk about ideas and concepts is integral to my working practice. However as an individual I can demonstrate strong organizational skills and personal initiative. I have repeatedly demonstrated my ability to work from a brief to design and develop a product within a budget and on deadline.

I believe that my strengths lay in my extensive experience developing content in XHTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript and mySQL, but also the diverse knowledge that backs this up. This allows me to work with multiple technologies and understand the needs of clients and fellow developers or designers. This also allows me to make informed decisions and to plan and manage projects effectively.

I follow agile development practices working with object orientated methodologies. This allows me to develop, test and deliver large scale applications that can be deployed onto multiple platforms quickly and easily. As a Web Standards evangelist I have a strong belief that applications can be developed following standards and accessibility guidelines yet still maintain advanced interactions, usability, and be an enjoyable intuitive tool for users.

My goal is to be involved in creative projects that are pushing internet technology to new levels and based on a useful idea, provide real world solutions.
