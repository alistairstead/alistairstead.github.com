It has been an absolute age since I last created any new content for this blog. The main reason has been simply that I have been very very busy doing other things. However it is also that due to the fact that creating content through a browser and storing it in a database just did not fit with the way I work.

I spend most of my day working in a terminal window. I choose a text editor over an IDE, speed and flexibility over features. Okay I don't go all the way back to basics I use [TextMate](http://blog.macromates.com/2011/textmate-2-0-alpha/) and [iTerm](http://www.iterm2.com/) with [ZSH](http://www.zsh.org/) and [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh). All of these things let me work in the simplest most flexible way.

My blog on the other hand always felt restrictive. So after some conversation on twitter /cc @mpmlopes @__debo I spent a couple of hours over the weekend making the leap to [octopress](http://octopress.org/). Although not loaded with features this lets me create content in the simplest format, markdown in this case and using Git and some Ruby it is baked into a static blog hosted on [Github](http://github.com/) using Github pages.

As you can see this has allowed me to create new content. Okay it is just an 'Updated Blog' statement but it is a statement of more to come. Some of what has been keeping me busy for the last 12 months should be good enough to create new posts.
