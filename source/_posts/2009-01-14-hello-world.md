Welcome to yet another wordpress blog. I have spent the last few months trying to complete my <a title="symflex cms" href="http://www.symflex.co.uk">symflex</a> cms project but have just not had the time to complete it. So rather than wait any longer and continue to delay my foray into the world of blog writing I have quickly uploaded wordpress and following the 5 minute install guide it is completely up and running.So here we are, yet another blog, yet another developer with something to say? Well I hope that a some point I write something that will be of use to someone. Here is a sneak peak at what I hope to write about over the next few posts.

* PokaYoke - one of my contributions to the <a title="symfony project" href="http://www.symfony-project.com">symfony</a> framework. Client side validation component that integrates with the symfony framework or that can equally well be used with any project that requires simple and very configurable clientside validation.
* Eclipse PDT - setting up the ideal combination of eclipse plugins for web development
* Parallels Virtual Appliance - setting up a Fedora based virtual machine to use as your development machine.

So there you have it. Welcome to my blog and feel free to pass judgment
